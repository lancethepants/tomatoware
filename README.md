Compiling
==========

Tomatoware can be compiled with different root prefixes. This allows it to co-exist with entware(-ng)/optware(-ng), which reside in /opt. The official project prefix is /mmc.

Edit `config.mk` to set the desired architecture and prefix and run `make`.

Debian 8 is used to build this project. An included Dockerfile can be used to create a working enviornment. Otherwise the following packages should be sufficient.

apt-get install automake bc bison build-essential cmake cpio curl flex gettext git libglib2.0-dev libncurses5-dev libtool libxml2-dev locales pkg-config python sudo texinfo unzip vim wget
